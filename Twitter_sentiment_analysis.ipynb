    "#### Regarding the general sentiment analysis, we can see that\n",
    "1. We see that cruz relation to trump is mentioned way more then beto's relation to trump, as we could expect. Cruz has a slight negative sentiment related to trump, while beto is surprisingly related to trump in a more neutral way. Further analysis on a larger sample could shed some more light and explain whether or not the relation is actually negative, and could effect negativly on Cruz\n",
    "2. We can see that Beto is related to justice more positively then Cruz (0.79 vs 0.41) and also with more mentions then Cruz. Although Cruz's relation to that issue is positive, he might want to emphasize more on that matter\n",
    "3. We can see that Cruz and Beto are both related to health issues in a positive way (0.47 vs 0.5), with beto having a slight more positively relation to it, Cruz might want to relate more to that issue and raise public opinion regarding his relation to it\n",
    "4. The most related candidate and issue are Cruz and Trump. Cruz should really carefully assess the influence of trump on his image and utilize trump's effect and power on public opinion in his favor.\n",

    "#### Regarding the geographic sentiment analysis\n",
    "1. First, we could see that given the diversity in locations in twitter, the relevant Texas sample size reduced drastically leaving us with a much smaller sample to create statistically valid insights from\n",
    "2. We could see that in small cities, Beto and Cruz's sentiments are very close, while in bigger cities the sentiment towards beto is more positive. This shows that Beto has a slight advantage on Cruz in bigger cities\n",
    "3. We can see that in general, there are more mentions of the candidates in big cities then in smaller cities, and this is interesting given the fact that small cities total population is 2 times the population of the big cities we chose. This might mean that people in smaller cities are less involved in politics then in bigger cities, and so the candidates would want to emphasize on bigger cities.\n",
